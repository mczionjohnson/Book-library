#





# MVC

# routes serving as Controller

# views

# models

# router
export the router

# public folder to render static file

# layout folder
carries the layout for all pages
a template to be render along with any body from the view specified in the route

# install dotenv
create .env file manually

added the database_url in the .env file

# add if statement in server.js to load if we are not in 'production'

# create .gitignore
added .env and node_module folder
turns grey
and ignored on git commands (add, commit and push)

# then push to a manually created repo on git
### Git push

# deploy on HEROKU but i deployed on Netlify-app

# create partials folder
for files not related to root
then include in layout (e.g. header)

# create _form_field.ejs
since its importing a partial and not an actual file
use this partial in the actual form of new Author

# magic
{ author: new Author() }
get body.name in form input
and pass it into the author Schema of Db through the route

# in routes post request
create a author var to connect to model
grab the text as req.body,name then input into db by author.save
if not text as required, error handling sends a errorMessage and populate the body back to client


# error message
created errorMessage.ejs in partials
grab any errorMessage text on the route by <%= %>
and imported the message in layouts by <%- %>

# Async Await
since mongoose uses async we want to use async too for CRUD/REST
so we use try for success and catch for error

# adjusted the errorMessage with if statement <% %>

# added the loop statement to get all authors and display on the index page
- created a searchOption to grab the client search as to req.query.name 
- uses regular expression to allow part or complete search of the text and uses case insensitive
- and check the loop for it 

# add the searchOption.name into the input.value of the form in the index.ejs
so on this page we have the name and the searchOption

### Git push

# created book route and model
we store image file on the files folder in the server and not in the database
we store a string name in the Db to connect to the file folders on the server to fetch the image

# views and route for books
populate data from author table into row related table
use this data on the forms in book view as select field

### data population 1
var are set and made available after the res, req
this var are used on the view page as objects
for loops are done on the Model/Db in the route/controller then the result is used in the view
e.g. Author.find({})

### data population 2
client side also have data and are made available after as objects in req.body req.params
this data from views can be used in the route/controller

# JSON Object <%= object == null ? '' : 'a'%>
if the object is null return empty string else return a

# ISOSTRING() converts date field to string with date and time
2022-06-08T20:21
ISOSTRING().split('T') removes all that comes after the T which is the time
ISOSTRING().split('T')[0] prints only the date part of this output

# a little read-up (stack overflow)
<%= "Hello world" %> 
Basically, what <%= %> does is to call the toString() method of the expression that is being evaluated.

### images
we want to keep it in the server (public folder)
keep only the path URL of that file (in the public) in the Db as a string
no image will be kept in the Db, just the path URL

from model, export the path to route as a var, join public folder and var with path.join()
set it as dest in multer, set imageMimeTypes and use in the fileFilter({ }) when callback when ) is null

the multer allows the file to be accessible as req.file


# multipart and path
enctype="multipart/form-data" included on the form
path.join to combine paths 'path', Book.coverImageBasePath
public folder and a row in the Book model

# const imageMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'images/gif']
set the supported file types on the upload in the router
use in the post router, allow single upload and name it 'cover'
upload.single('cover')

# ternary operator
req.file != null ? req.file.filename : null
if req.file is not null give req.file.filename else give null
e.g. if laptop = Mac ? 'Mac' : 'HP'

# using fs
file system library builtin by Node to manage files on the server
use it to delete bookCover saved while there is an error creating the book

# displaying images on the Book index view
- created a virtual entity in the book Model and connecting the path as:
return path.join('/', coverImageBasePath, this.coverImageName)
- make it available as a src="" on the img in books/index (view)

# const books = await Book.find({})
gets the all covers available since there is no filter
# const books = await Book.find(searchOptions)
is a filtered loop and fetch command

# using value on input in form
- this allows the data to be populated to the client when there is an error
- use the var/local names created in the route/req.params var (in this case 'searchOptions')

# query.lte l t e <=
query is less than and equal to
- query.lte('publishDate', req.query.publishBefore)
if publishDate is less than or equal to req.query.publishBefore
# query.gte g t e >=
- query.gte('publishDate', req.query.publishAfter)
if publishDate is greater than or equal to req.query.publishAfter

# re assigning const is not allowed, use let for re assign
- incorrect
const query
const books = await query.exec()
- correct
let query
const books = await query.exec()

# sorting
books = Book.find().sort({ createdAt : 'desc'}).limit(10)
a loop in book model and sorted in descending order
then returns only the first 10

# gitignore the public/uploads 
we are not only using it for development
this folder with be generated on the hosting side (e.g. heroku) during production
